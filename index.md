## Who are we?
Deis Robotics is a club team at Brandeis University. We're a diverse group of students connected by a common interest in robotics, and we're supported by the amazing Staff Supervisor, Timothy Hebert. Right now, we're really active in the fun sport of Combat Robotics, and we've attended a number of events at Norwalk Havoc Robotics Leage ([NHRL](https://www.nhrl.io/))


## What can you find in this website?
1. **Guides:** A hand-full of tutorials and write-ups, for things like wiring, designing, and manufacturing.
2. **Projects:** Our current robots, with links to each of their wikipedia pages at NHRL, under the 'Projects' tab. 
3. **Calculations:** A calculator you can copy and use to calculate a variety of parameters for a combat robot.
4. **Wiki:** A link to our team wikipedia page at NHRL. 

## Mission statement:
Deis Roboticsâ€™s primary goal is to provide students with the opportunity to learn about numerous aspects of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science in order to design and build fully operational machines.
The club seeks to unify the student body through their interest in technology by hosting numerous events and competitions where members will have the opportunity to learn about the manufacturing process of hardware, the creation of the accompanying software and participate in the construction of specific projects throughout the year. These learning opportunities will be facilitated by the club leaders in conjunction with Brandeis, staff from outside companies and organizations will organize numerous informational events.

## Club Leaders:
1. Emma Barash - Co-president
2. Nathan Cai - Co-president
