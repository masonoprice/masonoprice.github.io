### Mission statement:
Deis Roboticsâ€™s primary goal is to provide students with the opportunity to learn about numerous aspects of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science in order to design and build fully operational machines.
The club seeks to unify the student body through their interest in technology by hosting numerous events and competitions where members will have the opportunity to learn about the manufacturing process of hardware, the creation of the accompanying software and participate in the construction of specific projects throughout the year. These learning opportunities will be facilitated by the club leaders in conjunction with Brandeis, staff from outside companies and organizations will organize numerous informational events.
